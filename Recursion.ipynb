    "You now have a couple tools to solve programming, namely iteration and recursion. Both can be used in many situations, but recursion allows us to solve problems in a way that human beings cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider guessing someone's PIN. 8800 is mine. A human being could guess every single possible combination of numbers for a PIN (10,000 possible combinations), but that would take forever. 10,000 guesses is actually a relatively small number of guesses for a computer.\n",

    "1. A recursive algorithm must have a base case.\n",
    "2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.\n",
    "3. A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive backtracking will always have a base case, or it will go forever. In recursive backtracking, we add a concept called \"Choose, Explore, Unchoose\". When we want to change our state and move towards the base case (the second principles), we will generally have a few choices to make (following the PIN example, 10 choices, one for each number). When we implement recursive backtracking, we do this with Choose, Explore, Unchoose.\n",
